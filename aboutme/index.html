    <h2>Hello, my name is Thiago Rech!</h2>
    <h3>Web & Computer Development Student. </h3>
    <p>I'm Brazilian, I'm 25 years old, I'm a convert in the church, I was baptized in 2016 when I was 18 years old.
        I served a 2019-2021 mission to Mexico in Guadalajara at age 20. And I got married in 2021 at 23 years old.</p>
    <p>I currently work teaching Portuguese to Americans.
        I also work remotely for a company, providing services.</p>
    <p>I like playing the guitar, singing, and playing the piano. I love observing nature, animals, space.
        I really appreciate having true friendships, going out for walks, traveling, and having a good laugh.
        I really like video games.</p>
    <p>I really like creating things, drawing, designing... Taking ideas out of my mind and putting them on paper,
        with the aim of making people's daily lives easier, surprising and practical.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of difficulty learning, due to an attention deficit. But I love learning, even though it is
        sometimes a challenge for my distracted mind.</p>
    <p>I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and nerve management since I was 12 years old. Sometimes it's
        very complicated, but Christ always helps me overcome these challenges through my faith in his infinite atonement.</p>
    <p>I have many favorite scripture passages, but the one I will share here is D&C 130:18–19:
        “Whatever principle of intelligence we attain in this life will arise with us in the resurrection.
        And if in this life one person, by his diligence and obedience, acquires more knowledge and intelligence than another,
        he will have so much more advantage in the world to come.</p>
